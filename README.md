Codon Usage
===========

This repository is trying to investigate differences in codon usage among
various H. Sapiens populations and H. neanderthalensis. We are using data from
[1000 Genomes Project](http://www.internationalgenome.org/) and
[genome sequence of a Neandertal from the Altai Mountains](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4031459/)
for this purpose.
